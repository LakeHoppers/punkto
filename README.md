# Punkto

**Live:** [punkto.fyi](https://www.punkto.fyi)

Every morning, subscribers get a high-quality **Turkish, English or German** summary of the most important German news — not a translation, but a ranked, deduplicated, explained digest.

Built for Turkish, English and German speakers living in or following Germany: expats, professionals tracking the German economy, and anyone who wants "what happened in Germany yesterday and why it matters" in five minutes.

## Tech stack

| Layer | Choice |
|---|---|
| Frontend | Next.js (App Router), TypeScript, Tailwind, shadcn/ui |
| Backend | Next.js Route Handlers |
| Database | PostgreSQL (Neon) via Prisma ORM |
| Auth | Clerk |
| Payments | Stripe |
| AI | OpenAI (provider-abstracted; Claude/Gemini pluggable) |
| Delivery | Email (WhatsApp possible later; Telegram cut from scope) |
| Scheduling | Vercel Cron (daily pipeline), GitHub Actions (hourly email) |
| Deployment | Vercel |

> **Note:** this project runs on Next.js 16 and Prisma 7, both of which have breaking changes versus older tutorials/training data — e.g. `middleware.ts` is now `proxy.ts`, and Prisma Client requires an explicit driver adapter (`@prisma/adapter-pg`). See `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` and `.agents/skills/prisma-upgrade-v7/` for the authoritative current-version behavior before assuming older conventions.

## Getting started

```bash
npm ci
cp .env.example .env
```

Fill in `.env` with development values for your PostgreSQL database, Clerk, Stripe, OpenAI, Resend, and cron secret. Obtain team credentials through a private secret-sharing channel. Never commit `.env` or paste credentials into issues or pull requests.

```bash
npx prisma generate
npx prisma migrate deploy
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Team workflow

Clone the repository, then follow the setup steps above. Source code, docs, tests, public assets, database migrations, and the npm lockfile belong in Git. Dependencies, generated files, build output, and local credentials are excluded by `.gitignore`.

Create a branch for each change and open a pull request into `main`. Before requesting review, run `npm test`, `npm run lint`, and `npm run typecheck`. Use a development database when working locally; migration commands modify the database selected by `DATABASE_URL`.

Deployed to Vercel at [daily-news-saas.vercel.app](https://daily-news-saas.vercel.app) — daily pipeline via Vercel Cron, hourly delivery via GitHub Actions. Setup history and runtime measurements: [docs/DEPLOYMENT.md](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md) (note: some of that doc's "pending activation" language predates the actual production deploy).

Python migration phase 0–1: [decisions and verified slice](docs/PYTHON_MIGRATION.md), [backend setup](backend/README.md). The homepage opts into FastAPI with server-only `PYTHON_BACKEND_URL`; unset preserves the existing deployment.


Python migration phase 2a now provides a manual read-only ingestion/clustering/ranking
replay alongside the existing read API. See [backend commands](backend/README.md)
and [migration plan and verification](docs/PYTHON_MIGRATION.md). Production pipeline
execution remains TypeScript; Python makes no authoritative writes.


Python phases 2b–2c now include real AI adapters and a complete manual pipeline
with local-only checkpoint output. Production still runs the TypeScript pipeline.
See docs/PYTHON_PIPELINE_VERIFICATION.md (from the repo root) for commands,
real same-input comparisons, cost/runtime evidence and recovery limitations.


### Site languages

Public pages, account preferences, billing controls and embedded Clerk UI use
`/tr` and `/en` routes. Switch languages in the header. Old `/?lang=en` links
redirect to `/en`; unprefixed page links default to Turkish. The internal admin
UI lives at `/tr/admin` (`/admin` redirects there). API and scheduler URLs are
unchanged. Email language is still Turkish and is not changed by browsing `/en`.

Python Phase 3 now includes opt-in protected user/history, preferences, admin,
email and Stripe route ports backed by a private local sandbox. Production remains
on the existing TypeScript routes. See [migration status](docs/PYTHON_MIGRATION.md)
for verified parity, completed live auth/billing checks and remaining cutover gates, and
[backend commands](backend/README.md) to reproduce the isolated checks.
