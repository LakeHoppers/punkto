# News Daily Python read API

Read API: `GET /api/digests/latest?lang=tr|en`, `GET /api/digests/{date}`,
`GET /api/stories/{id}`. The default entrypoint exposes public reads only. Phase 3
protected/mutation routes require the explicit local sandbox described below.
See [migration decisions](../docs/PYTHON_MIGRATION.md).
Python 3.12 required. From the repository root:

```sh
python3.12 -m venv backend/.venv
backend/.venv/bin/python -m pip install -r backend/requirements.lock
backend/.venv/bin/python -m pytest -c backend/pyproject.toml backend/tests
backend/.venv/bin/ruff check backend/app backend/tests
```

Use the existing privately configured DATABASE_URL; never paste credentials into
terminal arguments. For local development only, load the root dotenv file without
printing it:

```sh
backend/.venv/bin/python -m dotenv -f .env run -- backend/.venv/bin/uvicorn app.main:app --app-dir backend --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000
```

In another terminal, enable the HTTP path only for that Next.js process:

```sh
PYTHON_BACKEND_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8000 npm run dev -- --port 3001
```

Without PYTHON_BACKEND_URL the existing TypeScript homepage behavior is retained.
When configured, backend failures surface instead of silently falling back. The
server fetch is uncached and has a 15-second timeout. Production URL must be HTTPS;
localhost HTTP is for local development only. Never set a localhost URL on Vercel.

Opt-in live read test (requires an existing nonempty Neon digest):

```sh
RUN_LIVE_TESTS=1 backend/.venv/bin/python -m dotenv -f .env run -- backend/.venv/bin/python -m pytest -c backend/pyproject.toml backend/tests -m live
```

No migrations or create_all calls. Connections and transactions are read-only,
use TLS verification, a small pool, connection/statement timeouts and repeatable
read snapshots. Before remote rollout, provision a dedicated SELECT-only role
separately; this phase does not modify database roles. The partial ORM metadata
must never be used to autogenerate schema changes.

Future host configuration (not deployed in this phase): repository root directory
`backend`, install `python -m pip install -r requirements.lock`, start
`uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port "$PORT"`, with private DATABASE_URL.
No persistent disk needed. Dependencies are pinned, including dev/test tools for
this proof of concept; split runtime/dev locks before production cutover.


## Phase 2a manual verification

From the repo root with the existing environment configured:

```sh
PYTHONPATH=backend backend/.venv/bin/python -m app.pipeline.dry_run --output /tmp/news-daily-phase2a
npx tsx scripts/compare-python-pipeline.ts /tmp/news-daily-phase2a
```

Optionally pass `--run-id <completed-run-id>` to replay a particular run. Artifacts
include feed XML, a database read snapshot and comparison JSON. Keep these local;
do not commit or place them in `public/`. There is no apply flag, write repository,
AI call, scheduler, new API route or migration. New RSS articles without stored
embeddings are not clustered in 2a; the clustering replay uses historical vectors.
See the migration document for exact parity results and reconstruction limitations.


Python phases 2b–2c now include real AI adapters and a complete manual pipeline
with local-only checkpoint output. Production still runs the TypeScript pipeline.
See docs/PYTHON_PIPELINE_VERIFICATION.md (from the repo root) for commands,
real same-input comparisons, cost/runtime evidence and recovery limitations.


## Phase 3a real read comparison

Run a local FastAPI server (example uses port 8013), then from the repo root:

```sh
npx tsx scripts/python-reads-reference.ts /private/tmp/news-daily-reads-reference.json
PYTHONPATH=backend backend/.venv/bin/python -m app.read_verification \
  --reference /private/tmp/news-daily-reads-reference.json --base-url http://127.0.0.1:8013
```

Use a fresh reference filename: the TS oracle refuses to overwrite files or save
inside the repository. This mode-0600 artifact contains private user information;
keep it local and outside public folders. Neither tool prints that payload. The
TS harness sets its connection read-only before importing Prisma; Python retains
its existing read-only engine/transaction guards. Comparison checks real public
HTTP responses, all category/locale history combinations and up to five existing
users without provisioning anyone. Only ordering unspecified by TS is normalized.

## Phase 3 protected API and isolated mutation verification

Production entrypoint `app.main:app` remains public-read-only. To explicitly run
the additional routes, create a private snapshot from the repo root and compare
actual TS handlers with Python's local transactions:

```sh
npx tsx scripts/python-phase3-snapshot.ts /private/tmp/news-daily-phase3.json
PHASE3_REFERENCE=/private/tmp/news-daily-phase3.json npx vitest run tests/unit/python-phase3-oracle.test.ts
cd backend
.venv/bin/python -m app.phase3_verification --snapshot /private/tmp/news-daily-phase3.json
# Optional real Stripe TEST sessions/event replay and Resend simulator only:
.venv/bin/python -m app.phase3_verification --snapshot /private/tmp/news-daily-phase3.json --external
# Manual, loopback-only API; never point production traffic or schedules here:
.venv/bin/python -m app.sandbox_server --snapshot /private/tmp/news-daily-phase3.json \
  --state /private/tmp/news-daily-phase3.sqlite --frontend-origin http://localhost:3012
```

Use fresh private paths. Both JSON files and SQLite contain copied user information;
keep them outside the repo. Reusing a SQLite path resumes its existing state and
does not re-import the snapshot. `DATABASE_URL` is read-only; SQLite is the only
mutation adapter. Local `.env` is loaded without printing it. The manual server
uses configured Clerk, Stripe test, Resend and cron secrets; it does not provision
or change any service configuration. It is a bearer-token API (no cookie auth or
cross-origin browser bridge). Use a browser-issued Clerk token with the exact
configured origin; never paste tokens into logs or commit them. Missing users are
not provisioned. Default `app.main:app` has no protected routes registered at all.

`--external` creates disposable test customers/uncompleted Checkout and Portal
sessions and sends to Resend's simulator. It reads prior Stripe test events and
locally signs/replays them into SQLite; it does not complete checkout, register a
webhook endpoint, charge money, or mutate an existing subscription. Missing historic
test events may mean the replay evidence must be collected again in a future test.
Real subscriber addresses are rejected before the Resend HTTP call.

New module structure retains application services with injected auth, state,
Stripe and email ports. Local read/mutation verification is not a replacement for
future Postgres write-adapter testing. See docs/PYTHON_MIGRATION.md for remaining
browser-auth and vendor-delivery verification gates and deliberate contract differences.

## Real browser + Stripe webhook verification

`app.browser_verification` is an explicitly started, loopback-only test page. It
loads real Clerk components and sends the browser's session token directly to the
Python API; tokens are never rendered. It copies only the selected reserved Clerk
test user into SQLite and discards production Stripe customer/subscription mappings.
The default production/read API does not register this test page.

1. In a live browser, sign up with a unique `+clerk_test@example.com` email, verify
   with Clerk's development code `424242`, visit the production dashboard to provision
   the test user, then sign out and back in. Enter passwords in the browser only.
2. Create a fresh private snapshot using `scripts/python-phase3-snapshot.ts`.
3. Install the official Stripe CLI at `~/.local/bin/stripe` (verify its release
   artifact SHA-256). Use an existing Stripe test key from the private environment.
4. From `backend/`, run:

```sh
.venv/bin/python -m app.browser_verification \
  --snapshot /absolute/private/snapshot.json \
  --directory /absolute/private/browser-verification \
  --test-email your-unique-test+clerk_test@example.com
```

Open `http://localhost:8014/verify`, sign in, and use the session/checkout/portal
buttons. The runner starts Stripe CLI forwarding real test events to the local
webhook. Its signing secret is captured in memory; it does not overwrite `.env`
or register/change a deployed webhook endpoint. The listener log and SQLite are
private files outside Git. Keep the process running throughout checkout and the
return redirect, then verify the local plan change and cancellation via the portal.
No real card or live-mode key should be used. Stop with Ctrl-C after testing.

A completed test requires observed browser login, a completed Stripe test checkout,
a genuine forwarded webhook, and matching local subscription state—not merely a
Checkout URL or a manually signed replay. The runner deliberately requires a
reserved test account, and never makes Python the authoritative production writer.

German compatibility: latest/history reads accept `lang=de`, using nullable German
summary fields with Turkish fallback. Preferences expose `emailLocale`; sandbox
email formatting and billing return URLs support DE. The shadow AI orchestrator
is still EN-only pending pre-cutover parity work; production German generation
runs in TypeScript. See `docs/PYTHON_MIGRATION.md` in the repository root.
