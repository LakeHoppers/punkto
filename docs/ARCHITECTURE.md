# Architecture

## Overview

Punkto is a scheduled ETL + AI pipeline behind a Next.js app. The core
loop runs on a cron trigger once a day; the web/app layer serves the results
of the last run plus user account management. Nothing here is real-time.

## Clean architecture layering

Each module is organized in three layers, independent of framework:

```
src/
  modules/
    scraper/
      domain/          SourceConfig, RawArticle types + interfaces
      application/      FetchArticlesUseCase
      infrastructure/    RssFetcher, HttpScraper, per-source adapters
    parser/
      domain/           ParsedArticle
      application/       NormalizeArticleUseCase
    dedup/
      domain/            ArticleCluster
      application/        ClusterArticlesUseCase (embedding similarity)
    ranking/
      domain/            RankedStory
      application/        RankStoriesUseCase (scoring rules)
    ai/
      summarizer/
        application/       SummarizeStoryUseCase (extract facts, then
                            summarize; provider-agnostic via DI)
        infrastructure/     PrismaSummarizerRepository
      providers/          OpenAIEmbedder, OpenAIFactExtractor, OpenAISummarizer
                          (Claude/Gemini equivalents are drop-in later)
    digest/
      domain/            DigestView types, startOfUtcDay
      application/        BuildDigestUseCase (ranks unused summarized
                          stories into the day's Digest/DigestItem rows)
      infrastructure/     PrismaDigestRepository (write side),
                          digest-view.ts (read side: latest/by-date/history,
                          used directly by API routes and Server Components)
    notification/
      domain/            due-check.ts (timezone-aware "is this user due
                          right now"), email-template.ts (pure, HTML-escaped
                          Turkish digest email builder)
      application/        SendDigestUseCase (finds due users, sends via
                          EmailSender, records DigestDelivery, isolates
                          per-user failures)
      infrastructure/     ResendEmailSender, PrismaNotificationRepository,
                          PrismaDigestReader (glues to the digest module's
                          read side — see digest/ above)
    billing/
      domain/            status-mapping.ts (Stripe status → our
                          SubscriptionStatus/SubscriptionPlan enums —
                          checked the installed `stripe` v22 SDK's actual
                          types rather than assuming; current_period_end
                          lives on subscription.items, not the subscription
                          itself, in this API version), plan-limits.ts
                          (Free/Pro gating rules)
      application/        CreateCheckoutSessionUseCase,
                          CreatePortalSessionUseCase, SyncSubscriptionUseCase
      infrastructure/     RealStripeGateway (wraps the `stripe` SDK),
                          PrismaBillingRepository
    user/                (unused so far — Clerk→User sync ended up as
                          `getOrCreateCurrentUser()` in shared/api-guards.ts
                          instead of a dedicated module; revisit if this
                          module grows real content)
  pipeline/
    orchestrator.ts       wires use cases together, called by cron route
  shared/
    ai-provider.interface.ts   AIProvider abstraction (swap OpenAI/Claude/Gemini)
    prisma.ts                  Prisma client singleton (driver-adapter based)
```

**Dependency injection**: use cases receive their infrastructure
implementations via constructor/factory injection rather than importing
concrete adapters directly, so each use case can be tested with fakes/mocks.
A module's `application` layer is the only thing other modules or routes are
allowed to import — nothing reaches into another module's `infrastructure`.

**AI provider abstraction** (`src/shared/ai-provider.interface.ts`) — split
into narrow, independently-injectable interfaces (interface segregation)
rather than one fat `AIProvider`, so e.g. the dedup module only depends on
`Embedder` and never sees summarization concerns:

```ts
interface Embedder {
  embed(text: string): Promise<number[]>; // for dedup/clustering
}
interface FactExtractor {
  extractFacts(input: ExtractFactsInput): Promise<ExtractFactsOutput>;
}
interface Summarizer {
  summarize(input: SummarizeInput): Promise<SummarizeOutput>;
}
interface AIProvider extends Embedder, Summarizer, FactExtractor { ... }
```

OpenAI ships first (`OpenAIEmbedder`, `OpenAIFactExtractor`,
`OpenAISummarizer`); Claude/Gemini are drop-in implementations of the same
interfaces, selected via the `AI_PROVIDER` env var.

**Extract-then-summarize, not one shot**: `SummarizeStoryUseCase` calls
`FactExtractor` first (grounds output strictly in the given article
snippets, merges duplicate facts, never invents anything) and only then
calls `Summarizer` with the extracted facts — not the raw articles. This
two-step split exists specifically to reduce hallucination risk in the
Turkish output, and matches "detect duplicates / extract facts / summarize"
being listed as distinct AI responsibilities in the product spec.

## Entities

| Entity | Purpose |
|---|---|
| User | App user (synced from Clerk) |
| UserPreference | Favorite categories, digest time, channel opt-ins |
| Subscription | Stripe subscription state (free/paid tier) |
| Source | A configured news source (RSS/API/scraper config, trust score) |
| RawArticle | Unprocessed fetched item from a source |
| Story | A deduplicated real-world event, grouping multiple RawArticles |
| Summary | Turkish AI output for a Story (headline, body, why-it-matters, tags), versioned |
| Digest | A generated daily edition (date, ranked Stories) |
| DigestItem | Join: Story ↔ Digest with rank |
| DigestDelivery | Record of a Digest sent to a User via a Channel |
| NotificationChannel | Alternate delivery address binding (unused in practice — delivery goes straight to `User.email`; Telegram cut from scope) |
| ScrapeLog | Per-source, per-run success/failure log |
| PipelineRun | Metadata for one end-to-end daily run |
| AdminAuditLog | Records admin actions |

Full field-level definitions live in [`prisma/schema.prisma`](../prisma/schema.prisma).

## Data flow (one daily run)

1. **Scraper** fetches `RawArticle` rows per active `Source` (RSS first-class;
   scraping only where legally reviewed).
2. **Parser** normalizes raw HTML/feed content into clean text + metadata.
3. **Dedup** embeds articles and clusters near-duplicates into a `Story`.
4. **Ranking** scores each `Story` (source trust, recency, cross-source
   corroboration) into `importanceScore`.
5. **AI summarizer** extracts facts and generates the Turkish `Summary`
   (headline, 2-3 paragraph body, why-it-matters, category, tags) via the
   active `AIProvider`.
6. **Digest builder** assembles the day's `Digest` from top-ranked `Story`
   rows.
7. **Notification service** delivers the `Digest` to each `User` per their
   `NotificationChannel` and `UserPreference` (favorite categories, digest
   hour, timezone).

## Runtime note: Next.js 16 / Prisma 7

This project was scaffolded against **Next.js 16.2** and **Prisma 7.9**,
both newer than most training data / tutorials:

- `middleware.ts` → **`proxy.ts`** (function renamed `proxy`, same
  semantics). See `src/proxy.ts`.
- Prisma Client requires an explicit **driver adapter**
  (`@prisma/adapter-pg` + `pg`) — there is no bundled query-engine binary in
  the default `prisma-client` generator path. See `src/shared/prisma.ts`.
- Datasource `url` lives in `prisma.config.ts`, not in `schema.prisma`'s
  `datasource` block. The installed version's config type only supports a
  single `url` (no `directUrl`) — see the comment in `prisma.config.ts` for
  how we handle Supabase's pooled-vs-direct connection split as a result.
- `prisma migrate dev` no longer auto-runs `generate` or seed — run them
  explicitly.

Before changing anything Next.js- or Prisma-specific, check
`node_modules/next/dist/docs/` and `.agents/skills/prisma-*/` — they ship
with the exact installed version and are more reliable than memorized
conventions.

## Deployment verification (2026-09-07)
Runtime PostgreSQL is now hosted on Neon following fresh provisioning. Historical
Supabase references above describe the original setup. Production builds generate
Prisma Client explicitly. Deployment and actual scheduled executions remain
unverified; hourly delivery is incompatible with Vercel Hobby's daily-only cron
frequency. The full pipeline still executes inside a single request.

RSS sources now execute concurrently; embedding workers are bounded at 15 and
isolate article failures (reported as `cluster.failed`). Story assignment remains
in input order after embeddings settle. Hourly delivery is now triggered by
GitHub Actions; only the daily pipeline uses Vercel Cron. See DEPLOYMENT.md:
the measured 336.96-second pipeline still exceeds Hobby's 300-second limit.

### Summarization and delivery follow-up (2026-09-07)
Five story workers now perform extraction → generation → persistence, preserving
per-story failure isolation. The latest live run took 128.35s (44 new embeddings,
15 summaries) versus the previous 336.96s (379 embeddings, 15 summaries); keep the
single-stage pipeline pending deployed verification. Delivery uses local hour >=
preferred hour, a current UTC edition check, and successful-delivery deduplication.
Failed records no longer count as received. This supersedes the timeout conclusion
and exact-hour delivery descriptions above. See DEPLOYMENT.md for evidence/limits.

Phase-1 Python read service now lives in `backend/`, preserving domain/application/infrastructure boundaries. Next.js homepage opts into its HTTP endpoint via `PYTHON_BACKEND_URL`; Prisma remains schema authority. See [PYTHON_MIGRATION.md](PYTHON_MIGRATION.md).

### Digest selection/replacement update (2026-09-08)
CandidateStory now includes category. The repository retrieves up to ten candidates
per category; BuildDigestUseCase applies a soft four-per-category limit, relaxing
it to fill ten slots when needed. Same-day item sets are replaced atomically,
including deletion of stale items. Source catalog expanded to 15; see SOURCES.md.


Translation recovery: after digest assembly, translate current items plus at most
five incomplete latest summaries from previously published digests. The recovery
query is independent of unused-story selection, excludes current IDs, and orders
oldest first. Five workers and a 30-second request timeout bound translation work;
provider output must contain three nonempty strings. No schema change is required.


Python phase 2a mirrors scraper/parser/dedup/ranking boundaries under backend/app.
Its manual pipeline runner reads a repeatable-read, read-only snapshot and produces
local plans; it cannot persist pipeline output. Stored embeddings are reused without
AI calls. Production orchestration remains TypeScript. See PYTHON_MIGRATION.md for
comparison evidence and the separate phase-4 scheduler/authoritative-write boundary.


Phases 2b–2c add manual Python AI/full-pipeline verification commands only. The
local orchestrator uses isolated JSON state, dependency-injected AI ports and no
production write repository. HTTP contracts, frontend behavior and production
scheduling are unchanged. See PYTHON_PIPELINE_VERIFICATION.md for evidence.


## Site localization (2026-09-09)

Next.js 16's `[locale]` root layout owns HTML language, metadata, Clerk locale
and the shared header/footer. `src/shared/locale.ts` is the single TR/EN type
and routing policy; typed UI dictionaries live in `site-copy.ts`, `home-copy.ts`
and `category-labels.ts`. Pages await route params, validate unsupported locales
with 404, then pass the locale to read-side queries and client controls.

Proxy canonicalizes legacy page links, including `?lang=en`, before enforcing
Clerk protection on localized dashboard/admin routes. `/api`, `/__clerk`, assets
and scheduler paths are not localized. The root defaults to Turkish; no browser
language or cookie inference changes an explicit URL. Header language switching
uses a full navigation on the same page to reset Clerk UI state. Admin is
canonicalized to `/tr/admin` and stays Turkish. Clerk's `appearance` is preserved.

Dashboard history now selects translated headlines with per-field Turkish fallback.
Preferences refresh the server-rendered history after saving. Billing receives a
validated optional locale and builds same-origin localized return URLs. Email
language, database schema, Python migration and production schedules are unchanged.

Reference: bundled `next/dist/docs/01-app/02-guides/internationalization.md` and
[Clerk localization](https://clerk.com/docs/guides/customizing-clerk/localization).


Phase 3a expands Python public read projections to dated digests/story details and
English latest summaries. New user domain/application/infrastructure read ports
resolve existing Clerk subjects without provisioning. Internal history reads reuse
the bounded digest repository; no protected API is registered until 3b implements
Clerk verification. Main read-only engine/transaction boundaries remain in force.
See PYTHON_MIGRATION.md for live differential evidence and 3b–3e scope.

### Python Phase 3 sandbox adapters

`backend/app/modules/auth` verifies Clerk sessions using the current SDK with
bounded JWKS caching and explicit issuer/origin/session checks. Protected routers
are registered only by explicit app construction. Existing SQLAlchemy projections
remain read-only. `StateStore` is the small injected transaction port used by user,
admin, notification and billing application services; `LocalState` implements it
as private SQLite outside the repo. It has no Postgres connection/write path.

The sandbox supports atomic version/audit changes, delivery claims and test-only
Stripe sync. Provider adapters restrict Stripe to test keys and Resend to its
simulator. `sandbox_server.py` binds loopback and has no scheduler. Admin-triggered
pipeline artifacts remain local. This adapter proves behavior, not production
storage scale or distributed locking. Production TS ownership and Prisma migration
authority remain unchanged; migration docs list the outstanding cutover gates.


### German locale and delivery language

The site uses `/tr`, `/en`, `/de` routes. `UserPreference.emailLocale` independently
selects the language passed through the notification reader and email formatter;
its database default is Turkish. Subscriber locale changes do not alter the
per-digest/user/channel dedup key. Latest-version Summary projections select
`headline/body/whyItMatters` in TR, or nullable `*En` / `*De` with TR fallback.
The post-assembly translator runs target-specific repositories concurrently with
a combined five-call limit (EN 3, DE 2); each target has a five-item historical
retry budget. Echoed source bodies are rejected/retried. German reuses grounded
Turkish output, so translation adds no source extraction or category assignment.
